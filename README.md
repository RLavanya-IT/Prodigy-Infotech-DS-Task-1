Welcome to my submission for Task 1 of the Data Science Internship at Prodigy Infotech. In this task, I have performed Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a dataset provided, focusing on creating a visualization to represent the distribution of a categorical or continuous variable.



**DATASET:**

The Dataset used for this task is [dataset.csv](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/17343811/dataset.csv)



**TOOLS AND LIBRARIES USED**

*Jupyter notebook
*Pandas
*Numpy
*Matplotlip & Seaborn for visualization


**CONCLUSION**

In conclusion, this EDA process provided valuable insights into the distribution of the selected variable in the dataset. This analysis lays the foundation for further exploration and modeling tasks in the data science workflow.

Thank you for reviewing my submission!
